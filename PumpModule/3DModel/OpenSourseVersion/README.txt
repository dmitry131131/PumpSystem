Open-Source Syringe Pump by AndreySamokhin on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4194094

Summary:
This open-source syringe pump has been designed for use in an analytical laboratory. Many open-source projects of syringe pumps have been developed since 2014. However, our project has several features:Universal clamp allows installing various syringes (D ≤ 25 mm)All parameters (including the inner diameter of the syringe, flow rate, target volume and time) can be changed using the control panel (which includes several buttons and two-line display); connection to a computer is not requiredInfusion, refilling or continuous (cycle) modes are availableDispensing accuracy and reproducibility are comparable to commercial syringe pumpsUnits of volume, flow rate and time can be changedIllegal input value (caused by discrete rotation of the stepper motor) is rounded to the nearest allowed valueAll settings are stored in non-volatile memoryAssembly takes several hours and requires almost no solderingSketch for Arduino, assembly and operating instructions are available at http://www.mass-spec.ru/projects/diy/syringe_pump/eng/STL-files of case are available at: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4194107The following video shows how the syringe pump works: https://youtu.be/0KjniIBHNMoA detailed description of the open-source syringe pump is presented in the following article: Samokhin, A.S. Syringe Pump Created using 3D Printing Technology and Arduino Platform. J Anal Chem 75, 281–287 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1134/S1061934820030156If you use this syringe pump in your research, please cite our paper.UPDATE (09 Dec 2023): the ‘carriage_lm8uu.stl’ file is added. When using standard linear bearings (i.e., LM8UU instead of LM8SUU), the bearings do not extend beyond the boundaries of the 3D printed carriage.
